# Kaggle-MNIST-Kannada-
Top 5% solution using CNN in Tensorflow2


The goal of this competition is to provide a simple extension to the classic MNIST competition we're all familiar with. Instead of using Arabic numerals, it uses a recently-released dataset of Kannada digits.

Kannada is a language spoken predominantly by people of Karnataka in southwestern India. The language has roughly 45 million native speakers and is written using the Kannada script. Wikipedia



This competition uses the same format as the MNIST competition in terms of how the data is structured, but it's different in that it is a synchronous re-run Kernels competition. You write your code in a Kaggle Notebook, and when you submit the results, your code is scored on both the public test set, as well as a private (unseen) test set.
